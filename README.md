# Bubble Shooter Game

A cross-platform puzzle game where you shoot colorful bubbles to create matches and clear the board. Available in multiple implementations for different platforms.

## 🎮 About the Game

**Bubble Shooter** is a fun and addictive puzzle game where you shoot bubbles upwards to match them with bubbles of the same color already on the board. When you create a group of 3 or more bubbles of the same color, they pop! The goal is to clear all bubbles before they reach the bottom of the screen.
