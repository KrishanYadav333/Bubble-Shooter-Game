## 🎮 Game Overview

In Bubble Shooter, you're armed with a launcher at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to shoot bubbles upwards to match them with bubbles of the same color already on the board. When you create a group of 3 or more bubbles of the same color, they pop! The more bubbles you pop at once, the higher your score.

But watch out – if the bubbles reach the bottom of the screen, it's game over! Use strategy to clear the board efficiently and aim for the highest score possible.
