h# Bubble Shooter - Python Desktop Version

A complete Python/Pygame implementation of the classic Bubble Shooter puzzle game, optimized for desktop computers with enhanced UI and smooth gameplay.

## üéÆ Game Overview

In Bubble Shooter, you're armed with a launcher at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to shoot bubbles upwards to match them with bubbles of the same color already on the board. When you create a group of 3 or more bubbles of the same color, they pop! The more bubbles you pop at once, the higher your score.

But watch out ‚Äì if the bubbles reach the bottom of the screen, it's game over! Use strategy to clear the board efficiently and aim for the highest score possible.
